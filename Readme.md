## Honest Disclaimer

- This is a **UI clone for learning purposes only**
- There is **no backend** - all data is in JavaScript arrays
- **Nothing persists** - refresh and everything resets
- Posts, users, and conversations are all mock data
- The interactions (like, retweet, bookmark, reply) work correctly in-session
- Not affiliated with X Corp. or Twitter in any way

3. **Authentication** - JWT or OAuth
4. **Real-time** - WebSockets for live notifications
5. **Storage** - S3 or Cloudinary for media
